# Swift-SolarSystemWeight

I developed this app to show the user their weight on all of the different planets in the solar system and the moon. The main page is Earth, and after they enter in their weight on Earth they can choose any one of the 9 buttons. The other planets include: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. Their weight on Earth should be entered in as pounds. Each button takes the user to a different page with the name of the planet, a picture of it, and their weight on that planet.
